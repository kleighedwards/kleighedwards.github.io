		<h1>Working through Java the Hard Way</h1>
		
		<h2>Discussion Topics</h2>
		
		<h3>Switch vs. If/Else Statements</h3>
			<p>What is the difference between ‘switch’ and ‘if/else’? 
			When would you use one versus the other?</p>
			
			<p>Both “switch” and “if/else” statements can be used to compare variables. 
			Switch statements are much more simplified than if/else statements, but they 
			are also more limited in use as a result. Switch statements can only hold a 
			single value as a variable (or an expression that simplifies to a single 
			value). You cannot define variables within a switch statement. You are also 
			unable to compare whether the value inside the switch statement is less than, 
			greater than, greater than or equal to etc. to another value. It simply checks 
			to see whether or not the two variables are equal. 

			There are benefits to using switch statements, however. Once the computer 
			begins to read the code for a certain “case,” it will continue running  this 
			code until it hits a “break.” This means that, in certain instances, you can 
			leave large portions of your code essentially blank, as long as you include 
			what is necessary before the break. 

			In the “ThirtyDays” exercise in Java the Hard Way, for example, we were able 
			to do just that. In the latter half of the assignment, we were told to compare 
			months of the year based on how many total days each month had. As most months 
			have either 30 or 31 days, we were able to, in essence, group those months 
			together as they were all included before the break statement.

					switch(month)
					{
							case 9:
							case 4:
							case 6:
							case 11: days = 30;
				   					 break;

			If/else statements, in comparison, can be used for a wide variety of 
			comparisons. You are able to include multiple values/variables and you are 
			able to define variables within if/else statements. You are also able to 
			compare values less than, greater than, etc. to each other. Unless the data 
			you’re working with is fairly simplistic, it’s best to use if/else statements.</p>
		
		<h3>The Difference Between ( = ) ( == ) and ( .equals )</h3>
			<p>When would you use ‘=’ vs ‘==’ vs ‘.equals’? Explain what each of these 
			does and in which cases you should use them.</p>
			
			<p>A standard equals sign ( “=“ ) is often used for defining or “declaring” 
			variables. Say for example your code included an integer ( x ) with a value 
			equal to 10. You could declare the variable as: “int x = 10”. That particular 
			integer now holds a value of ten. 

			Two equal signs ( “==“ ) are used to note when two values are equal to each 
			other (or to check if two values are equal to one another). If you wanted to 
			set two variables as equal values, you would use this notation. 
			For example: “x == y”. This tells the computer that the variables x and y are 
			of equal value. 

			That may work well enough with numeric values, but when it comes to words 
			or phrases (Switch values), different notation is needed. The “.equals“ 
			notation is used to set two words or phrases equal to each other. Say your 
			program utilizes a password function. You would need a way to check to see if 
			the password being entered matches the password stored on file. 
			For example:
			
			typedPassword.equals(“WhateverThePasswordActuallyIs”)</p>
		
		<h3>For, While, and Do While Loops</h3>
			<p>What is the difference between a ‘for’, ‘while’ and ‘do while’ loop? 
			Give an example of when you would use one versus another. What is the benefit 
			of a ‘do while’ over a ‘while’? </p>
			
			<p>“For,” “while,” and “do while” loops all allow you to repeat chunks of code 
			so long as certain conditions are met. For loops operate quite a bit 
			differently from while and do while loops in that you are able to set the number 
			of times the code will loop. At the start of a for loop, you initialize (or 
			give a value to) a variable, the code will then loop as long as the condition 
			you set is true, and then the program will update the variable based on the 
			parameters you define. 

			For example, you initialize a variable ( x ) with a value of 1. You then tell 
			the computer to continue looping until x is greater than or equal to 10. 
			Finally, you tell the computer how to modify x. Say you want to add 2 to x at 
			the end of each loop. As long as x is less than 10, the program will run this 
			code. As soon as these conditions are false, the program will exit the loop. 
			If you know how many times you would like your program to loop, you may want 
			to use a for loop.

			While and do while loops, however, will continue to loop indefinitely so long 
			as the condition is true. (The number of loops being a value you do not 
			explicitly outline in your code.) Say, for instance, you would like the user 
			to guess a number. You can use while/do while loops to repeat code 
			indefinitely until the user guesses the correct value. 

			One benefit do while loops have over regular while loops is that the program 
			will check for the condition at the end of the loop as opposed to the 
			beginning. This means that the program will always run the code in the body of 
			a do while loop and then check to see if it should continue looping. In a 
			while loop, the program will check the condition before even entering the loop 
			and will skip over it entirely if the condition is false. </p>
		
		<h3>Importing additional objects</h3>
			<p>What happens when you include ‘import java.util.Scanner;’ in your code? 
			Where does this functionality come from? What is the ‘java’ in 
			‘java.util.Scanner;’?</p>
			
			<p>Not all programs function in the exact same way. Therefore some programs 
			may require different tools than others to operate. Java (along with many 
			other programming languages) has several different toolsets or “libraries” to 
			pull from in these instances. Say you want your program to include some sort 
			of user input (in this case typing something on the keyboard). You would need 
			to specify in your code that you would like to utilize the keyboard. Including 
			code to import a “Scanner” object, tells the computer to look inside of 
			these additional Java “libraries” for the right tools for this task. With this 
			new toolset, your program is now able to utilize the keyboard and you are now 
			able to interact with the user in a way you couldn’t before. This “Scanner” 
			is only on of many additional functionalities stored in a variety of Java 
			libraries.</p>
		
		<h3>Math.random() function</h3>
			<p>To generate a random number you use ‘Math.random()’. What is ‘Math’? 
			What is the return type of the ‘.random()’ method. Why is the ‘M’ in ‘Math’ 
			capitalized.</p>
			
			<p>As mentioned before, Java has a variety of different toolsets you can 
			utilize. Some of these tools can only be accessed when perusing through Java’s 
			additional libraries (like the “Scanner” object in the previous entry). 
			Others, however, are simply built into the language at its core. “Math” is one 
			of these built-in objects. Incorporating the function “Math.random()” in your 
			code asks the computer to provide a random double value between 0.00 and 0.99. 
			Making alterations to the “Math.random()” function will change what sorts of 
			random values the computer prints out. You could, for example, ask the 
			function to print an integer instead of a double or even alter the range of 
			values to 1 - 5 or even 20 - 200 (whatever values you like). 

			It’s worth mentioning that Java is a “static” language, meaning that your code 
			is case sensitive. Typing “math.random()” instead of “Math.random()” will 
			cause errors when you eventually go to compile your code. </p>
